# Detection-of-Tomato-leaf-diseases
Through the implementation of deep learning algorithms in our Tomato Disease Detection project, we have achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 94%. This remarkable level of accuracy underscores the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in discerning and classifying tomato diseases, even at early stages. By leveraging the power of machine learning and computer vision, we have not only provided a highly reliable tool for farmers and growers to detect plant diseases swiftly but also demonstrated the potential for cutting-edge technology to significantly enhance crop management and food security. This 94% accuracy rate signifies a major stride toward more efficient, sustainable, and productive agriculture in the tomato farming sector.
